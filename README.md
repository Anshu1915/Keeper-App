# Keeper-app
The goal of the Keeper app project using React.js is to create a web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The application should be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and responsive user interface. The app should allow users to create multiple notes, each with a title and a body, and should allow users to easily switch between notes. The app was built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces so as to gain the basic knowledge of React.js.

The process of developing the Keeper app using React.js involves planning and design, setting up the development environment, implementing the UI and functionality, styling the app, testing and debugging, and deploying the app to a hosting platform.

FEATURES:
Note Creation: Users should be able to create new notes with a title and body. Note Editing: Users should be able to edit the title and body of existing notes. Note Deletion: Users should be able to delete notes that they no longer need. Note Search: The app should provide a search function that allows users to quickly find notes based on their titles or contents. Search function should be fast and responsive. Note Sorting: Users should be able to sort notes by title or date. Responsive Design: The app should be designed to work well on a variety of devices and different screen sizes. Accessibility: The app should be designed to be accessible to all users. Error Handling: The app should handle errors & provide meaningful error messages to the user when something goes wrong. Security: This app should be designed with security in mind, including protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access.
